# XJBFiles

XJBFiles is a file storage application that enables users to organize files by dragging and moving to record their daily lives. 
See [XJBFiles Site](https://quiet-dawn-62332.herokuapp.com/).

## Key Features
- Create, upload, and delete all the files (Photo, Text, Video or other documents)
- Store and organize files with different dates
- Drag and drop files into the Date panel

## Motivation
Everyday life inspires the project. Group members all had experienced an awkward time when we failed to find the files we need when it is urgent. In our daily life, we often edit files multiple times and make them into several different versions. Alternatively, we finished the task days ago while we forgot the file location when we need to use them. In both cases, we find it hard to locate the files fast and accurate. Therefore, we are inspired to create the XJBFiles application to organize files by date, aiming to make an easier life for working people and students.

## Target Audience
- Working people and students who have a large number of working schedules which may change every day, and many different kinds of documents need to be stored according to the date.
- People who love to record everyday life: Through our calendar storage function, these people can store photos, recorded videos and other documents of special times such as travel, anniversaries or even everyday life in folders according to the date, which will be meaningful for recording life and make it easy to make a commemorative album.
